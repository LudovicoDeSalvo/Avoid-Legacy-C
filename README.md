# Avoid Legacy C++

This is an old version of my game AVOID, that can be found [HERE](https://lastnight0.itch.io/avoid)

This is version is completely different from the version linked above, which is much more advanced in every way. The compiled executable works only in windows 7 (probably also in earlier windows versions), doesn't work in windows 10/11.

Futhermore this version requires the pdcurses34 library to compile
