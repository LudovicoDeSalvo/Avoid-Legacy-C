# Avoid Legacy C++

This is an old version of my game AVOID, that can be found [HERE](https://lastnight0.itch.io/avoid)

This is version is completely different from the version linked above, which is much more advanced in every way. The project was made in CodeBlocks. The compiled executable (found in \bin\Release) works only in windows 7 (probably also in earlier windows versions), doesn't work in windows 10/11.

Futhermore this version requires the pdcurses34 library to compile.
